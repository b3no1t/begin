    <p id="code-of-conduct">
      People all over the world play video games. That's why we support an
      inclusive and welcoming video game ecosystem for new and experienced
      gamers alike. In our stores, we host community events to bring together
      diverse members of the gaming world. We do not support intolerance or
      abuse in games and have created a code of conduct so that everyone feels
      safe in our space.
